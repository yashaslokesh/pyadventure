Some extra updates are on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yashaslokesh_)

**Update, January 2nd:**

Used the text.ScrollingText class to implement this animation, used a generator that would yield an increasingly growing list to draw the lines of the text.

**Update, January 13th:**
![Gif for walking animation demo](../demo-gifs/04-walking-animation.gif)

Added some functionality to add sprite moving speeds and to change those moving speeds, though the ability to change sprite movement speed for a certain animation might be removed in the future, I can't think of a good enough reason to keep it. Pygame will detect a key being held down and will fire a KEYDOWN event which I use to run the walking animation.
